# OpenStreetMap Location Selector Setup

This feature allows you to select any location on OpenStreetMap and display it on your salon website.

## Features

- Interactive map using OpenStreetMap (completely free, no API key required)
- Search for locations by name or address
- Drag markers to pinpoint exact locations
- Automatic address lookup
- Map embedding on your website

## How It Works

The location selector uses:
- **Leaflet.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps
- **OpenStreetMap**: A free, editable map of the world
- **Nominatim**: A search tool that uses OpenStreetMap data for geocoding

## Using the Map Selector

1. Go to your admin panel and navigate to the "Settings" page
2. In the "Map Location" section, you'll find the interactive map
3. Search for your salon location by typing and pressing Enter
4. Fine-tune the position by clicking on the map or dragging the marker
5. Click "Use This Location" to update the map embed URL
6. Click "Save Settings" to update your website

## Advantages Over Google Maps

- **No API Key Required**: Works right out of the box
- **No Billing Setup**: No credit card or billing account needed
- **No Usage Limits**: No need to worry about exceeding free tier limits

## Troubleshooting

- If the map doesn't load, check your internet connection
- If search doesn't work, ensure your browser supports fetch API
- For best results, use specific addresses when searching
